# Design Index
## About
I started this directory because I know what it’s like to be an average designer with big ideas and limited resources. I spent hours searching for high-quality mockups, fonts, illustrations, icons, and color tools — most of them scattered, overpriced, or hard to find.
But over time, I discovered a world of free and underrated resources that helped me improve my work dramatically.This site is my way of giving back — a curated collection of design tools, inspiration, and assets that are:

    Handpicked for Quality
    Mostly free or freemium
    Built to help you grow as a designer

Whether you're just starting out or already working on client projects, I hope these resources help you save time, learn faster, and create better work.
